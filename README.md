# Oil-Prices-Stock-Market

Last year, Dr. Bernanke wrote a blog post that tried to shed light on what was driving the
change in oil prices, with the goal of explaining at least part of the puzzling co-movement in oil prices
(WTI crude) and the stock market.I recreate one of the figures from that analysis, which drew heavily on a
blog post by James Hamilton at UCSD.
